# Kazam Todo

**Kazam Todo** is a web-based task management application designed to seamlessly handle your tasks with the power of **Redis** for caching and **MongoDB** for persistent storage. It provides real-time updates, a clean user interface, and a scalable backend architecture.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Add, Delete, and Fetch Tasks:** Simple and intuitive task management.
- **Redis Caching:** Fast task addition and retrieval with efficient caching.
- **MongoDB Storage:** Persistent storage for tasks after Redis caching threshold is exceeded.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Tasks are updated seamlessly in real time.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript for scalability and maintainability.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- Frameworks/Libraries: React (if applicable)

### Backend:
- **Node.js** with **Express**
- **TypeScript**

### Database:
- **Redis** for in-memory caching
- **MongoDB** for persistent storage

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Task Addition:**
   - Tasks are first added to **Redis** for fast access.
   - Once the number of tasks in Redis exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50 tasks), they are moved to **MongoDB** for long-term storage.

2. **Fetch Tasks:**
   - Tasks are fetched from **Redis** for fast responses.
   - If Redis is cleared, tasks are fetched from **MongoDB** as a fallback.

3. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Redis ensures fast task updates while MongoDB provides a reliable backup.

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure it with:
     ```env
     PORT=5000
     MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     REDIS_HOST=<your-redis-host>
     REDIS_PORT=<your-redis-port>
     REDIS_USERNAME=<your-redis-username>
     REDIS_PASSWORD=<your-redis-password>
     REDIS_KEY=FULLSTACK_TASK_VIVEK
     ```

4. **Start the Server:**
